Sajal Halder, Kwan Hui Lim, Jeﬀrey Chan, and Xiuzhen Zhang. POI Recommendation with Queuing Time and User Interest Awareness. In Data Mining and Knowledge
Discovery, pp. 1–31, 2022

In this research work, we aim to answer the following research questions. 
  
    (i) Are user interests important for recommending top-k POIs?

    (ii) Are user interests important for recommending top-k POIs and predicting queuing times simultaneously?

    (iii) How does POI description based user interests perform compared to the POI category based user interests?
